An emulated version of Delimited Continuations suitable for experimenting and testing.
<br>This code is used in the Open Source Project https://github.com/portablesimula
and is suitable for that purpose. It is not tested in other environments. Any help is welcomed in improving it.
<br>This version should be replaced by project LOOM,s code when it becomes available in a future Java release.
